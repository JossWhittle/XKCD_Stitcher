# DISCLAIMER!
I claim no ownership to any of the images stored in /src/images and all subsequent sub-directories. All artwork on this repo comes from http://xkcd.com/ and more accurately http://xkcd.com/1110/ 

The reason I have included the copies of the original images that I downloaded (using cURL) is because I wanted to save anyone who uses this repo from having to spend ages querying the xkcd server with lots of request that will likely come back blank.

The modified images stored within the sub-directories aforementioned are simply resized versions of the original artwork, used to speed up rendering.

Randall, I am HUGE fan. Please don't sue me.
